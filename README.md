 # 10 Algorithmic Data Science Questions
 Here is a list of 10 Python-based algorithmic questions that might be asked during a data science or machine learning job interview.

## 1. Sorting Algorithms
Question: You are given an unsorted list of numbers. How would you sort them? Explain and implement the sorting algorithm of your choice.
Follow-up: Discuss the time and space complexity of your chosen algorithm. Compare with alternatives like QuickSort, MergeSort, and BubbleSort.

## 2. Find the Median
Question: Given a list of numbers, find the median without sorting the entire list. Explain your approach.
Follow-up: Use the QuickSelect algorithm or Min/Max Heaps for efficiency.

## 3. Remove Duplicates
Question: Given a list of numbers, write a Python function to remove all duplicates while maintaining the original order.
Follow-up: Discuss the time and space complexity of your solution.

## 4. Anomaly Detection
Question: Implement a function that identifies outliers in a dataset using statistical measures like mean and standard deviation.
Follow-up: Explain how your algorithm would handle large-scale data and how to optimize it.

## 5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Question: Write a Python implementation of the KNN algorithm for a classification problem. Include steps for distance computation and majority voting.
Follow-up: How would you optimize KNN for a high-dimensional dataset?

## 6. Clustering
Question: Implement the k-means clustering algorithm from scratch. Given a dataset, group the points into k clusters.
Follow-up: How do you handle scenarios where the clusters do not converge?

## 7. String Matching
Question: Implement an algorithm to check if a string is a subsequence of another string. For example, "abc" is a subsequence of "aebdc".
Hint: Use a two-pointer approach or dynamic programming.
Follow-up: Discuss time complexity and compare your solution to alternatives.

## 8. Data Aggregation
Question: Given a dataset represented as a list of dictionaries, write a function to compute aggregate statistics (mean, median, mode) for a specified field.
Follow-up: Explain how your function handles missing or invalid data.

## 9. Recommendation System
Question: Write a Python function to calculate cosine similarity between two users' preference vectors.
Follow-up: Discuss how you would scale your implementation to handle millions of users and items.

## 10. Sliding Window Technique
Question: Implement a function to find the maximum sum of a subarray of size k in a list of integers using the sliding window technique.
Follow-up: Discuss the benefits of using the sliding window approach over a brute-force solution.
