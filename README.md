 # 10 Algorithmic Data Science Questions
 Here is a list of 10 Python-based algorithmic questions that might be asked during a data science or machine learning job interview.

### 1. Sorting Algorithms
You are given an unsorted list of numbers. How would you sort them? Explain and implement the sorting algorithm of your choice.


### 2. Find the Median
Given a list of numbers, find the median without sorting the entire list. Explain your approach.


### 3. Remove Duplicates
Given a list of numbers, write a Python function to remove all duplicates while maintaining the original order.


### 4. Anomaly Detection
Implement a function that identifies outliers in a dataset using statistical measures like mean and standard deviation.


### 5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Write a Python implementation of the KNN algorithm for a classification and regression problem.


### 6. k-means Clustering
Question: Implement the k-means clustering algorithm from scratch. Given a dataset, group the points into k clusters.
Follow-up: How do you handle scenarios where the clusters do not converge?

### 7. String Matching
Question: Implement an algorithm to check if a string is a subsequence of another string. For example, "abc" is a subsequence of "aebdc".
Hint: Use a two-pointer approach or dynamic programming.
Follow-up: Discuss time complexity and compare your solution to alternatives.

### 8. Data Aggregation
Question: Given a dataset represented as a list of dictionaries, write a function to compute aggregate statistics (mean, median, mode) for a specified field.
Follow-up: Explain how your function handles missing or invalid data.

### 9. Recommendation System
Question: Write a Python function to calculate cosine similarity between two users' preference vectors.
Follow-up: Discuss how you would scale your implementation to handle millions of users and items.

### 10. Sliding Window Technique
Question: Implement a function to find the maximum sum of a subarray of size k in a list of integers using the sliding window technique.
Follow-up: Discuss the benefits of using the sliding window approach over a brute-force solution.
